Some tools that works with DOM:
    - Hamurger_menu.js --> Hamurger menu 
    - clock_alarm --> set a clock and run an alarm
    - keyboard_events --> add shortcuts and interaction with keyboard arrows
    - countdown --> return a countdown to a determined date (in this case, my birthDay)
    - scroll_top_button --> add a button that moves to the top of the page 
    - responsive --> depending on sceen size, you will see different content. It helps to get a better performance when you are on your phone.
    - responsive_tester --> opens a new windows with the parameters in the form
    - device detector --> detects the devise and browser from where the user is connected. Then shows a message thats only shown in chrome, edge and firefox
